>useage of caching and APIs, users will come in and hit your 3rd party APIs. without a cache
the api will hit the database or another 3rdpaty API.

>As you scale, you get more volume, you will get more latency and latency. So you might have to put a cache or maybe databse replicas
>We have a concept of rate limiting on 3rd party API calls eg 1000 requests per minute. so we wont be able to make that work

>A common solution is caching infront of datastores.

API -> CACHING LAYER[REDIS] -> 3rd party API/database


We have time expiration on caches, so values in them dont live forever. TTL cache
