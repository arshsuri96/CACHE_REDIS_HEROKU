>useage of caching and APIs, users will come in and hit your 3rd party APIs. without a cache
the api will hit the database or another 3rdpaty API.

>As you scale, you get more volume, you will get more latency and latency. So you might have to put a cache or maybe databse replicas

API -> CACHING LAYER[REDIS] -> 3rd party API/database


We have time expiration on caches, so values in them dont live forever. TTL cache

// we created handler to contain cache and data.
//added handler to extract info from 3rd party API
//next step is to add caching
